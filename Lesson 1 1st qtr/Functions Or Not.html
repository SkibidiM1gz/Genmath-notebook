        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <h3>Now, what is a function?</h3>
        <p>A function is a type of relation or a rule of correspondence between two
nonempty sets such that, to each element of the first set called domain,
there corresponds one and only one element of the second set called
range.</p>
<h3>Remarks:</h3>
<p>A function is said to be a ‚Äúwell-behaved‚Äù relation. Why? This is because
given a starting point, we know exactly where to go. Given a value, say x,
we get only and exactly one value of y.</p>
<p>This means that while all functions are relations (since they pair
information), not all relations are functions. In fact, functions are a
sub-classification of relations.</p>
<h1>MAPPING DIAGRAMS: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h1>
<image src="Relations Function.png" width="750" height="200">
</image>
<p>Given a relation of x and y, we say ‚Äúy is a function of x‚Äù if for every element x in the domain,
there corresponds exactly one element y in the range.</p>
<p>With that, only figures a and c are functions. Figure b is not a function.</p>
<p>For a mapping diagram, each value of x can only correspond to only one value of y</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTIVE RULE: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
<ol>
        <li>the rule which assigns to each person his aunt/s<br>
        This is NOT A FUNCTION since a person can have more than one aunts.</li>
        <li>the rule which assigns to each car to its plate number<br>
        This is a FUNCTION since a car can only have one plate number</li>
        <li>the rule which assigns each student to his/her moderator<br>
        This is a FUNCTION since many students can be assigned to a one
moderator.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h2>SET OF ORDERED PAIRS: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
<h4>{ (SUPERMAN, DC), (BATMAN, DC), (THE FLASH, DC),
(SPIDERMAN, MARVEL), (CAPTAIN AMERICA, MARVEL),
(WOLVERINE, MARVEL) }</h4>
<p>This set of ordered pairs is a FUNCTION.</p>
<p>For a set of ordered pairs to be a FUNCTION, there should be NO
REPETITION OF THE X-COORDINATE.</p>
<h2>TABLE OF VALUES: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
<image src="Tabular.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
<h3>This table of values is a
FUNCTION.</h3>
<p>no
repetition
of the
entries on
the left
column </p>
<h2>GRAPH: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
<p>If we are given a graph, how do we know if it‚Äôs a function or not?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vertical Line Test: A graph represents a function if
any vertical line drawn through it intersects the
graph at most once.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used to visually determine if a graph represents a function. Just slide any
vertical line (think of your pencil)<br> across the graph to see if any two or more
points of the graph lie on the same vertical line.</p>
<p>If there are no two or more points on the same vertical line, then the relation is a
FUNCTION.</p>
<p>If there are two or more points on the same vertical line then the relation is NOT
A FUNCTION.</p>
<h2>Applying Vertical Line Test</h2>
<image src="Graphs2.png" width="750" height="200"></image>
<h2>EQUATION: FUNCTION OR NOT?
</h2>
<p>It is relatively easy to determine whether an equation is a function by<br>
solving for y. When you are given an equation and a specific value of x,<br>
there should only be one corresponding y-value for that x-value. For
example,</p>
<ul>
    <li>ùë¶ = ùë• + 1</li>
</ul>
<p>is a FUNCTION because y will always be one greater than x. </p>
<ul>
    <li>ùë¶ = ùë•
<sup>2</sup> ‚àí 1</li>
</ul>
<p>is also a FUNCTION; although x-values of 1 and -1 give the same y-value<br>
(0), which is the only possible y-value for each of those x-values.</p>
<h3>However,</h3>
<ul>
    <li>ùë¶
<sup>2</sup> = ùë• + 5</li>
</ul>
<p>is NOT A FUNCTION. If you assume that x=4, then</p>
<ul>
    <li>ùë¶
<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 5
</li>
<li>ùë¶
<sup>2</sup> = 9</li>
</ul>
<p>and this has two possible y-values: -3 and 3. Recall that for each x-value,<br>
there should only be one and exactly one y-value for the equation to be a<br>
function.</p>
